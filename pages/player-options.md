# Player Options

This work is based on the information on the Security Clearance Levels page of the [SCP wiki](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/security-clearance-levels). These options replace the background and starting gear steps from Liminal Horror. Players should refer to the Liminal Horror character creation [rules](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Character%20Creation/) to determine [Ability Scores](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Character%20Creation/Steps/) and [Character Traits](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Character%20Creation/Character%20Traits/).

## Notes for the Facilitator

Depending on the setting have the players generate a character from an appropriate option table. For situations where the players are on the ground dealing with an unknown SCP in the field consider using Civilians, Cultists, D-Class, and field personnel with Level 2 or lower. Limiting the classification level of the player reduces the amount of information that a player has access to. In containment breach scenarios have players select from D-Class and Site Staff with a at most Level 4 clearance for the Site Director. A player with a high clearance level should be given about the anomalies in the facility and the known containment strategies. Also consider adjusting the player assignments, weapons, and investigative tools to match the desired story. Players without weapons will have difficulty fighting and will need to avoid combat.

## Civilians
